  <h3>Essential tools for modern websites</h3>

  <p class="more">
    Let's face it: do you really need drag-and-drop, resizable windows

  <p>
    Websites are not desktop applications. They are different. What
    you really need is high usability, striking visual effects and all
    those "web 2.0" goodies that you have seen on your favourite
    websites.
  </p>

  <p>
    This library is an answer to this need. All tools can be used
    together, extended, configured and styled. You'll find your
    personal way of using the library.

  <p>
    You can pick your own selection of tools from the download page or
    you can load the most common combinations directly from a free
    Content Delivery Network (CDN).
  </p>

  <p>
    The CDN is configured with the proper expire headers and
    compression settings so that the file loads fast. This CDN can be
    used in production environments without any charge.

  <p>
    From each demo there is a minimal version without redundant HTML,
    CSS or JavaScript. You can use them as templates and fine tune
    them to your requirements. They provide a quick way to get
    started. You are also free to use and modify all the graphics
    you'll find.

<h2 class="first">Understanding <em>jQuery Tools</em></h2>

<p>
  jQuery Tools is a collection of the most important user interface
  components for the web. These are tabs, accordions, tooltips,
  overlays, exposing effects and scrollables. They can dramatically
  improve the usability and responsiveness of your site. They mainly
  focus on <em>presenting information</em> and <em>visual
  appeal</em>. After all, this is exactly what most websites
  desperately want: to present their content to the reader in an easy
  and visually pleasing manner.
</p>

<p>
  Other JavaScript UI libraries focus on desktop-like features such as
  drag-and-drop, ranges, sortable tables or draggable windows. They
  are meant to build "rich internet applications" (RIAs) such as email
  clients, task managers, CRM software, image organizers or feed
  viewers. These kinds of applications are very useful within a small
  group or when used in intranets; however, normal websites are very
  different in nature. Their purpose is to look good and present
  information. jQuery Tools are built exactly for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
  It is recommended that you start designing your pages without using
  any JavaScript. There are many examples of highly functional, good
  looking and user friendly web sites that are not using
  JavaScript. The purpose of this library is to enhance an existing
  site with the great possibilities that modern JavaScript techniques
  have to offer. This is essentially the idea of "progressive
  enhancement" which is a common design pattern today. You should
  realize that highly professional sites don't overuse JavaScript just
  for the fun of it. Scripting is only used when it truly makes the
  pages more readable and user-friendly. This is where these jQuery
  Tools come into play.
</p>

<p>
  This library is not a framework with a steep learning curve, lots of
  preliminary work and strict coding rules. You are not tied to any
  predefined HTML or CSS structures. You can include the library on
  your pages and start using it immediately. You can freely design the
  look and feel of your site or you can use any of the designs we
  present in our demos as a template.
</p>

<p>
  These tools can be easily combined. Think of scrollables that
  trigger overlays or overlays that contain scrollables together with
  tooltips or whatever combination you can imagine. The possibilities
  are endless. And if that is not enough, you can harness the enormous
  power of the jQuery library. Many times you see complex JavaScript
  components implemented that could be done with just a few lines of
  jQuery code. For many websites, this may be the only JavaScript
  library necessary.
</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;margin-top:20px">
  The old UNIX design philosophy <strong>"tools, not policy"</strong>
  is very important in web design.

<h2>Browser Support</h2>

<p>
  jQuery Tools have been proven to work with the following browsers:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> 2.0+</li>
  <li> <a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/">Internet Explorer</a> 6+</li>
  <li> <a class="external" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> 3+ </li>
  <li> <a class="external" href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">Opera</a> 9+ </li>
  <li> <a class="external" href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> 1+ </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you encounter any problem with jQuery Tools and any of these
  browsers, please report it to the <a href="/forum/20">jQuery Tools
  forum</a>.

<a name="flowplayer"></a>
<h2>jQuery Tools and Flowplayer</h2>

<p>
  You must have noticed that this project is hosted on the Flowplayer
  website. This is because some of the tools were initially developed
  for making widgets that work well with video
  sites. <samp>Scrollable</samp> was made for building playlists
  and <samp>Overlay</samp> was made for showing videos over other
  elements on the page. Little by little those widgets matured to the
  point where they are now.
</p>

<p>
  Today Flowplayer and jQuery Tools have nothing specific to do with
  each other. Flowplayer is a video player and jQuery Tools is a
  generic user-interface library for the web. Of course, they can be
  used together because both are well behaving pieces of
  software. Here is a quick example of how videos can be overlayed on
  a page:
</p>

<div class="codebox"><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>  <span class="c1">// install flowplayer into a container element whose id is &quot;player&quot;</span><br />  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">player</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;player&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/media/swf/flowplayer/flowplayer-3.2.7.swf&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span><br />&nbsp;<br />  <span class="c1">// setup button action. it will fire our overlay</span><br />  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;a.overlayLink&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">overlay</span><span class="p">({</span><br />&nbsp;<br />  <span class="c1">// when the overlay is opened, load our player</span><br />  <span class="nx">onLoad</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span><br />  <span class="nx">player</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">load</span><span class="p">();</span><br />  <span class="p">},</span><br />&nbsp;<br />  <span class="c1">// when the overlay is closed, unload our player</span><br />  <span class="nx">onClose</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span><br />  <span class="nx">player</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">unload</span><span class="p">();</span><br />  <span class="p">}</span><br />  <span class="p">});</span><br /></pre></div><br /><figcaption>JavaScript</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>
  Flowplayer is Open Source software licensed with the GPL&nbsp;3 open
  source license. There are also commercial licenses that allow us to
  focus full time on the development of tools and the player
  itself. They also allow us to provide the free content delivery
  network for the users of jQuery Tools. There is currently no
  possibility of expressing your satisfaction through making a
  donation; however, if you are interested in showing videos on your
  site you could consider purchasing a
  <a href="/download">Flowplayer commercial license</a>.
